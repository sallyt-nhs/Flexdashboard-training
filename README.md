# Flexdashboard-training

A work-along to create your first flexdashboard.

## Getting Started

This training works best if you have a two-monitor setup: one screen to display the guide document, and the main screen for RStudio code and output.

Open the [Flexdashboard training](https://github.com/sallyt-nhs/Flexdashboard-training/blob/main/flexdashboard-training.html) document. It has been written for you to follow along, as you build your first (not very pretty) flexdashboard.
